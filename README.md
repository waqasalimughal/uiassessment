# HTML and CSS Project Read Me

Welcome to my HTML and CSS project! This project showcases a basic web page design using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

This project is a part of my UI assessment in web development. I've created a simple web page to demonstrate my understanding of HTML and CSS.

## Instructions

To view the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser of your choice. You can also explore the project files to see how the HTML and CSS are structured.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styling for the web page.
- `icons`: A directory containing images used in the project.
- `fonts`: A directory containing fonts used in the project.
-  `js`: Js files for any interactive features (if applicable).

## Design Choices

- I've chosen a clean and minimalistic design, using a soft color palette to create a visually pleasing experience.
- The layout is responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
